Joomla helps to develop a website very easily. Joomla can be easily installed, handled and managed. 
When discussing Joomla security, we must take into account both the Joomla framework and its extensions. 
If you check the Joomla security Centre, you will find the list of all latest vulnerabilities related to all versions (https://developer.joomla.org/security-centre.html). 
If you check closely, it is clear that joomla itself is quite stable and less probe to attack.  Most of the time, only some XSS, SQL, LFI, etc. will be identified in the core which are already fixed and patched.
